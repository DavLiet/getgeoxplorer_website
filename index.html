        GeoXplorer allows you to instantly explore far distant lands from Earth
        and Mars using the power of augmented reality!
      </p>

      <p>
        This app was created by the
        <a href="https://virtualplanet.wustl.edu/"
          >Fossett Laboratory for Virtual Planetary Exploration</a
        >
        to help students understand the complex, three-dimensional nature of
        geologic structures. Rather than having to physically travel around the
        world to study specific geologic specimens, students and researchers can
        easily use GeoXplorer to browse thousands of 3D terrain models, learn
        about them, and view them in augmented reality just as they would in the
        real world!
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, we've developed natural gesture controls that allow users
        to rotate, resize, and manipulate 3D models so you can easily "Xplore"
        every small detail.
      </p>

      <p>
        From Martian terrain samples collected by NASA's Mars Reconnaissance
        Orbiter to Devil's Tower in Wyoming to rare hand samples too delicate to
        handle, we are constantly expanding the catalog of 3D models available
        through GeoXplorer.
